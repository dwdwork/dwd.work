You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.
- George Washington
- John Adams
- Thomas Jefferson
* George Washington
* John Adams
* Thomas Jefferson

To order your list, precede each line with a number.
1. James Madison
2. James Monroe
3. John Quincy Adams

Nested lists
1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item

Nested lists without monospace, count characters that appear before list item, then type that number of spaces in front of the nexted list item
100. First item(100. ) = 5 characters
     - no monospace after 5 characters(     - ) 7 characters
       - no monospace after 7 characters, 2nd nested list

To create a task list, preface list items with a hyphen and space followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].
- [x] #1
- [2] https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/issues/740
- [a] Add delight to the experience when all tasks are complete :tada:

You can add footnotes to your content by using this bracket syntax:
Here is a simple footnote[^1].
A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  
You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].
[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.

Add comments the same way as you do in HTML
<!-- Commented Text -->

You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character.
